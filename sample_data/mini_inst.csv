instagram,criss-cross-applesauce 🍎 I contemplated posting the photo where I’m sucking it in more... but at the end of the day I thought this one was cute so 🤷🏼‍♀️ as I keep learning to stay body positive & really love myself  I think moments like this where I take the step to embrace myself really are meaningful. Self love takes practice  as does everything in life... so don’t be hard on yourself & post the damn photo if you like it even if there’s a roll because you’re hot as is 🔥

instagram,One of the most frequent questions clients ask me is about dessert and what makes the best one. Reality of successful weightloss does not include eating dessert regularly. I always suggest having a lot of sweet hearbal tea after dinner to satisfy sweet craving yet not detour from the weightloss plan.

instagram,Some days it’s Shoreditch House and glam launches ✨✨  but most days it’s @jimmyplaysbass‘ old tracky bottoms  socks AND slippers  mascara shadows under my eyes  never more than 3 inches from a @pawpatrol toy  no bra and a house exploding in plastic and dirty plates 🤣. Some pics are aspirational and shiny  most are just me  taken on my smashed phone  a bit blurry and dull. My life is story of two halves. I’m lucky the ✨shiny✨ stuff exists - it’s fun and fabulous - but actually I love nothing more than being in trackies  with my hair up  bra off and getting sh*t done 👊🏼 Thankfully for every one of the shiny-glam-days  there are 5 stay-at-home-in-trackies days and I’m ok with that.

But  after seeing @bookedandready’s story about the #25infive readathon  I began to ho & hum over a TBR  and sketched out a tracking page in my book journal. I started a day late  since it began on the 8th  but with the weekend and a laid back Friday night  I think I’ll be able to catch up. I love that this is a bit more doable  and works so well with the constraints of real life! Pictured is my tentative TBR  all of these are on my February booklist  so we’ll see what I can get through in the next three days!

instagram,HAPPY THANKSGIVING . We are so thankful to be celebrating with family and friends today. Modern life can be so noisy and chaotic its easy to lose track of all the wonder in our world. Today we hit pause. We breathe deep. We put aside our differences and gather round the feast. . The meal may not look like a magazine spread. There might be elbows on the table and more than one person who refuses to eat their veggies. But at the end of the day  we are all grateful to be here. . The incredible chocolate babka in this picture was baked by my dear friend Emily @westoftheloop  styled by me and shot by my husband @jtandexler for the cover of her new website.  Her friendship and the fun we had shooting together is just one of a zillion things I am thankful for today.
instagram,Having the best long weekend in Michigan. Always a treat to visit @greyghostdetroit 🧡
instagram,I feel like a broken record  but this age. THIS is my favorite age. I loved it with Ava too  and it's just as adorable the second time around. Liv says "Dank Du!" (Thank you) all the time and "Peas!" (Please). Just this morning she started saying "oh pity (pretty) peas mama!" She saves that for something she reeeally wants (that I'm of course saying no to). But "pity peas"?! Come on...give the kid whatever she wants...cupcakes for breakfast? Done! Pjs to swim in the pool? Sure!😂😍 What is your favorite age? 💗Also  my super cute and comfy dress is from @shoprubyjune a new store started by my friend @lisa.williams08  check it out!!💗

instagram,Rough housing is my #1 love language. . And not only does it bring me immense joy to throw my kid on the bed and tickle him until he can hardly breathe  it’s also the best opportunity to talk to him about consent. . Earlier this week I was chasing him and he started yelling  through laughter  “Stop  mama!!” and I immediately stopped dead in my tracks. When he looked confused and disappointed and said  “Again mama?” I explained to him that when he tells me to “Stop” I will stop because I respect him and his words. I reminded him  as I do annoyingly often  that games are not fun and they are not okay if not everyone playing feels safe and is having fun. No means no and stop means stop. . He nodded and then said  “Again  Mom?” And the tickle monster reemerged and the fun was back on. We chased and tickled for the next 20 minutes and he never told me to stop again. Boys are smart! (Not creatures who simply cannot help themselves.) . The more we teach our boys how to listen and respect women’s words  the less we’ll need to teach our daughters how to “avoid” sexual assault 🙄. . Parents of boys: This is on us. #believewomen #boymom #boyswillbeboys #whichinmyhomemeans #respect #integrity #courage and #empathy

instagram,We talked to our missionary this morning then skipped work and spent the day in Death Valley. Badwater Basin is the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below sea level. It was about 90 degrees there today and it was my first semi hike since last October. It was amazing! Yes that's snow on those mountain peaks behind us  they are at 11 000 feet above sea level.

instagram,Sometimes we get to travel as a family  (like this #tbt from our trip with @charlottesgotalot ) and sometimes (like today) the 4 of us are in 3 different cities. 👨‍👨‍👦‍👦 . When we were in Charlotte for pride  we met another family👪 while waiting in a long line for ice cream (worth it b/c @jenisicecreams is 🤯). This kind family listened intently as our boys chattered on about their lives: how they have two homes  how they have 3 dads (their mom recently remarried) and silly less important things like how their dads are YouTubers (they watch other creators on the YouTube kids app so that makes us cool dads in their eyes.) . In another time or place that couple may have felt the need to protect their son from our modern "alternative family." Instead we were made to feel welcome and totally ordinary. . Pride for us means our boys don't have to be ashamed of their family  and we're so grateful that we can live in and visit places where this is our reality. . #charlottesgotalot #clteats #queencity #sponsored

instagram,I’ve been loving my daily dose of peppermint tea-it’s aromatic  refreshing and undeniably minty. Since my solo trip to Morocco  it’s been a favorite ritual of mine. *  @tradmedicinals sources their peppermint from  partner growers at Washington State’s Trout Lake Farm and their pristine conditions and organic practices help achieve a medicinal-grade crop that’s rich in essential oils  giving the tea a distinctive minty taste and soothing digestive benefits. It’s the perfect pre- or post-meal tea to support the digestive system for a “no bloat” experience. * Today I kick off 3 Teas  3 Weeks with Traditional Medicinals-I’ll incorporate 3 teas into my daily routine for 3 weeks. Join me and see how you feel! Check out their website (TraditionalMedicinals.com/3Teas3Weeks) for a buy 2  get 1 free deal on your teas.  #sponsored #TraditionalMedicinals #3Teas3Weeks #Peppermint

instagram,When she lost her gloves  I was actually pretty proud that they had lasted over 5 years. When she lost her NEW umbrella  I was less proud and made her really search before finally replacing it. When she lost the garage door opener to the RENTED garage  she did search the entire house before finally buying TWO replacements.  While this whole “I lose stuff” thing is super cute and one of the things we all love about the human  now it has crossed a line. She has lost her winter boots. Boots people. Huge  heavy  banana-sized winter boots. How does one lose a pair of boots? Let’s just say this...they better be in her closet on wheels (a.k.a: her car) or this is going to be a really uncomfortable winter. #lost #ilosestuff #wherearemyboots #khaomanee #instacat_meow #nc_cuties #lifewithcats #cats_of_instagram #catstagram #cats_of_world #meow #heterochromia #oddeye #purr #excellent_cats #topcatphoto #wintersucks #chicago #snow #whitecat #catball #instacat #cold #cutecat

instagram,Who says you can’t eat healthy while traveling? The hard part is making the decision to do so. It’s not always easy for me but I try to keep two out of my three meals clean and healthy and then I’ll eat one meal that may not be so clean - that usually means wine🍷dessert🍰etc. For me  it’s all about maintaining healthy balance and enjoying life.  I’ve been on trips where I allowed myself to eat crap all week long and although I didn’t feel guilty when I did  it would take me a full week when I got back to feel good again and not sluggish. It’s not worth it to me to do that anymore but you’ve gotta do what works for you!💗 I’m enjoying my last full day in Denver before we head back to Houston tomorrow. Hope everyone is having a great week! #eathealthy #whatsonmyplate #nourish #eatforhealth #gf #jerf #healthylunch #kalesalad #poweredbyplants #beets

instagram,Living room view to the south... Nothing but corn and bean fields.. And that beautiful country sky.💖 I came home from antiquing empty handed  even though I wanted all the things..😕 I have actually thought of having a little booth of my own at my favorite little antique store.. my house is slammed packed full of stuff.. and I love my old crap but would like to purge a little.. How fun could it be to sell some things to peeps who are stoked to buy my crap/junk/ treasure??? And junking would be "working" and that sounds pretty awesome...but I already have a full time job and a house to take care of.. so just as soon as I think I wanna do it  I second guess it...

instagram,HAPPINESS. Are some people born with it? Maybe. Do some of us struggle for it? Definitely. ⠀ .⠀ Here’s where I stand. Every one of my core values has come from something I struggle with...⠀ • Motherhood/family — infertility ⠀ • Faith — worry + self-doubt ⠀ • Courage — fear of what people think⠀ • Authenticity — trying to be someone else because I wasn’t enough for myself⠀ • Humor — taking myself too seriously⠀ .⠀ These values are like a lantern that light my way. Every time I’m in struggle  it’s because I put my lantern down. Sometimes I have to struggle for a while and work through things before I’m ready to pick the lantern back up again. But every time I use my lantern  I am truly HAPPY. ⠀ .⠀ Do people have to work for their happiness? I sure do. But what about you? Share one thing that makes you truly happy and give me a 💪🏼 if you’ve worked hard to get there. #littlemissfearless #mytruth #thehappynow

instagram,⚡️THE TIME HAS COME TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH! ⚡️ I have finished my 30 Days to Healthy living and man! I wish there they were not over. These were truly 30 days to healthy living for the REST of your life.” - I am a coffee addict 🧐I haven’t had coffee in 32 days! The first couple of days; I didn’t have massive headaches but felt “out of the zone”. The fizzies helped me & I ❤️them. - I saw an amazing shift in my mindset towards food. It’s no longer about comfort but nourishment. - I was less hungry during the the 30days - I snacked less - I ate until I was satisfied - Less sweet cravings - My energy has been incredible! I feel like my mind has opened up and I no longer feel lethargic or drained. - My workouts got waaay better. - I gained 2 pounds  but I feel and look leaner. So that’s muscle gain. 💥This program will do for your body what your body needs. The beauty of this product is the overall lifestyle changes and benefits you get. I cannot recommend this program enough. I’m sad it has ended and will continue to live my life with a clean eating structure - It’s the best thing I have done for my health. ✨ I will continue to host groups every month that want to better their lives. Trust me  this is an investment in your health. A 100% MUST. And I’m here to help you. 🍃 If you’ve been watching me and waiting to see & hear about my results  here they are. Please message me if you want me to go more in depth into any of them or if you want more info! EXCITED and HAPPY to help many others. Everyone deserves feeling like this. ❤️. #junkfood #healthyhabits #bloatedbelly #tiredmom #guthealing #hangry
instagram,Happy birthday to a true superwoman. I was taller than her by 4th grade  but I’ve never stopped looking up to her. She supported me through every school milestone and woke up at 4am to take me to every out of town soccer game over and over again. The best person I could have in my life  let alone have as my mother. Thank you mom for all of the sacrifices you made over so many years  and still continue to make!! #throwback #bestmomever

instagram,I went to do a different entry on John for the Word Nerd kit  and this caught my eye: in the HCSB Bible  it has the first part of John 1 aligned in poetry form. God's word is not only true and worthy of study  but it is beautiful  creative  and poetic  expressive of God's creativity and character. "The Word shows me who God is." I used Faber Castell big Brush pens to outline the illustration already in the margin and then added pieces from the #wordnerd kit. • As we settle into October  grab your Word Nerd kit by clicking the affiliate link in my profile linktree.

instagram,Soooo.....I have had this arch in my spine that makes my belly stick out since the 3rd grade.

instagram,2 more sleeps ‘til Christmas!!

instagram,January 10th and I’ve just done my first workout of 2018! Opting for #fullbodyworkouts for the next few weeks till I get some level of strength back.  Also going to consistently add a stretch to my routine. It’s SO important and something I admit to skipping when I’m in a rush! Choose one song on your gym playlist and commit to stretching from start to finish. That’ll give you a minimum of 3-4 mins! And you won’t feel it pass.  I’ve FINALLY started my 2018 journey! 🙌🏻

instagram,||Fresh Start by Himalaya Wellness|| I have been using @himalayapersonalcare since the time they launched their Neem and Oil Clear facewash years ago. Then came the neem face pack. Having been blessed with an extremely high maintenance oily and acne prone skin  these two products were my constants for many years. I still have the neem facewash on my shelf which I use on the days when my skin is super oily or erupting those ugly looking polka dots. Himalaya launches 4 new variants of their Oil Clear facewash skin which are definitely a breeze of fresh air. 1. Peach 2. Strawberry 3. Lemon 4. Blueberry They all smell great and clean the oil from the skin gently and effectively. My favourite is Strawberry! You can buy these online or from a store near you. #himalayafreshstart #stayoilfreestayfresh #himalayawellness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . #collaboration #facewash #oilclear #oilyskin #combinationskin #skincare #oilyskincare #facecleanser #skincareroutine #skinista #selfcare #facecare #thatssurbhi #prettymummasays #potd #productphotography #oilyskincare #cosmoaugsev

instagram,Those products that you use everyday...like your face wash  your moisturizer  and your lip balm. Do you know what’s actually in them? Or where they’re made? Or the effects they may have on the planet? _ The answer for most of us is probably no. At least it was for me...until a few years ago.  _ But it doesn’t have to be that way. We have the right to know everything about the products we use and the companies who make them. To ensure that we’re making the right choice  not just for what we need  but for the planet too. _ Take this Skin Warrior Anti-Pollution Repair Cream by @naturallyseriousskin - It’s free of sketchy additives like phthalates  formaldehyde  petroleum (common ingredients in most skin care products). It’s made in a glass jar and packaged in a paper carton that’s FSC certified. Aaannnnnd  it’s made right here in New York  which means: ✅it’s got ingredients I feel comfortable putting on my skin ✅the packaging won’t end up in the landfill after I’m done using it ✅and it has a low carbon footprint 👉🏼All good things _ Soooo...let’s play a little game. Head to your bathroom  pick up a product you use on a regular  and read the back of the package. Do the ingredients look confusing and ambiguous? Where is the product made? And how do you feel about the packaging?  _ Share what you find in the comments below 👇🏼 _ _ _ #sponsored #naturallyserious #zerowasteliving #ecofriendlyproducts #nowaste #consciousconsumer #zerowaste #nontoxic #sustainableliving #ecobeauty #lowimpactmovement #goingzerowaste #lowwaste #lowimpact #carbonfootprint #lesswaste #purchasewithpurpose #zerowastehome #zerowastelifestyle #ingredientsmatter #cleanbeautyrevolution #greenbeautycommunity #yayforearth #ourplanetourhome #zerowastejourney #lowwasteliving #sustainablysourced #sustainablymade #sustainablepackaging #naturalhealthrevolution
instagram,When I was little and asked what I wanted to be when I got older  I often said “a mother”. Sometimes I just stare at this sweet girl in disbelief that she is mine....& that I get to spend the rest of my life raising her  loving her and helping her grow. Some people have those “I made it” moments when they land a long desired job or get a promotion of some sort...my “I made it” moment came when she was placed in my arms for the very first time and it often comes back when she smiles back at me or gives me a squeeze around my neck. I am so lucky to be her momma 💕

instagram,AMEN. I always believe this every time people that I trust betrayed me and only using me for their own advantages without saying anything or do things behind my back. God is on my side. #treatpeoplewithkindness #amen #always . . #Repost @thecauseindonesia with @get_repost ・・・ "The Lord will fight for you while you [only need to] keep silent and remain calm." - Exodus 14:14 (AMP) .  Many times when you faced challenges  you will want to fight by doing something about the situation. You feel like you have to make things happen. It is as if all the responsibilities are on your shoulders  and you are left alone to fight your own battle. But Jesus is telling you that your battles are not yours to fight. When you put your trust in the Lord  it is not about what you do or how good you do it. It is about who Jesus Christ is and what He is able to do for you. So you will only need to keep silent and remain calm  for the battle is the Lord's. #LifeatTheCause #thecauseindonesia

instagram,Supplements: I reached a breaking point today and I cannot contain this rant any longer 🙃 - I have seen more and more talk of supplements on social media recently. A lot of very large accounts  accounts that I respect  accounts that should know better; preaching the use of supplements. And when I talk supplements in this case I’m referring to BCAAs to vitamins to cleanses to all varieties of powders and blends. - The sponsored athletes and the insta stars all talking about what they’re taking. And in turn  influencing us to believe we should be to. We are lead to believe that we are not strong enough  not healthy enough  not balanced enough – and supplements will make all these things possible. - Let's keep it simple ▪ Eat a wide variety of nutritious foods to meet your energy needs. ▪ If you already do this and have further concerns about your health  seek advice from your GP or a specialist. - Please stop using supplements simply because you think you should  or to mask a more serious problem. Eat well  exercise often  seek professional guidance. Stop with the blind following of fitpos. You deserve to be treated as more than just another customer. . . . . #fitspo #health #3dmj #science #nutrition #nutritionpriorities #supplements #supps #fitness #fitnessindustry #weightloss #fatloss #fatlossinspiration #weightlossinspiration #holistichealth #healfromwithin #nourishing #healthyliving #healthylifestyle #iifym #countingmacros #girlswholift #fitnesscommunity #gymshark #gymsharkwomen #energyseamless #diet #dieting

instagram,Here’s to loosening up old knots and tying new ones (with yourself). The greatest lesson was learning that self-attack is the archenemy and the wounds from that kind of attack are so terribly slow to heal. I think I caught myself before I could do anymore damage  and I vow - in self-love to myself - to steer clear of those unfriendly skies; to never put a bullseye to my own heart from the fiery arrow that is some me. Happy #vday ❤️ __ Editorial interpretation for @cartier 2/14/17 talun.me #tb

instagram,Some important life lessons from the universe that I’ve re-encountered in these last couple months: 1. Relieve yourself of any relationships or friendships that are draining. You need your good energy. You need it so that you can share it  and you can’t give or share what you lack. You should be able to give from a place of abundance and overflow. If they don’t somehow inspire you  teach you  or push you to be better in the same way that you do for them  evaluate what you’re getting out of the friendship. If the laughs and good times are enough for you  then great. But if it isn’t worth it  do away with it. 2. When the universe tells you to make room  you listen. If you feel an incisive energy that compels you to make space in your life and trust the universe  don’t resist it. Remember that good things fall apart so that better things can fall together  but this can only happen if you make room in your life for these new and better things. 3. Surround yourself with people who uplift you  challenge you  respect you in all circumstances  and are as good as you or better than you at anything - at your craft or any craft  at business  at relationships  at facing fears  anything. Surround yourself with people you can learn from  this is the only way you get better and grow as a human being. That said  I’m eternally thankful for the few people I have who do just that. You guys are some serious keepers. 💪🏽⚡️ Trust the Source and it will provide. 💛 // 📸: @jess.onesto at @femmefair x @peerspace 🎀

instagram,Are you spontaneous when it comes to travel? Do you show up without a plan & just go with the flow or do you you have an entire excel sheet full of activities planned?  My biggest travel planning tip would be to leave room for both. For the most part  we showed up to Iceland without a plan. We booked our camper a week ahead of time & had a rough idea of stops we wanted to make along the way. I think balance is important when it comes to planning trips. Leave room for spontaneity but research is important because you could be missing out on some really incredible sights if you have no idea they exist. With a bit of wiggle room  you can pop into a random bar because you hear live music & or hangout with that group of strangers because they invited you to their table to have a drink. These things happened to us in Iceland and our free/nonexistent schedule allowed us the freedom to just go with the flow. At the same time  we had a few “must-dos” that we were sure to make time for. Sometimes we’d ask ourselves if we were spending too much time at one stop or if we should be seeing/doing more but it’s more important to cater your trip your interest & doing what feels right to you. Quality is always more important than quantity.

instagram,“Mornings like this one were made for memories.” ― Maggie Stiefvater  Blue Lily  Lily Blue . . I’ve come to realize that the most important beings in my life came to me as complete surprises. ..My now husband asked me to a dance in high school. We were halfway through the night when I realized I’d been nervous because I liked him. I wasn’t expecting it. Not one bit. Eleven years later and sometimes it still surprises and overwhelms me how much I love him. ..Quigley was no different. It might shock you  considering the fact that I am now undeniably a crazy ferret lady  but it was my husband who wanted a ferret. I wasn’t so sure. But the same day we got the go-ahead from our landlord  five years ago today  I found Quigley in a classified ad. Not even an hour later he was on his way home with us. I remember telling him once  because he was two when we got him and he’d had two homes before us  that he would never have to find a new family again. He was ours forever. He was mine. ..He helped people understand ferrets. That they are not rodents. They’re carnivores and they were domesticated to help hunters flush prey from their burrows  so their paws are made like shovels and their sense of smell is incredible. That they do have a scent  but they don’t stink. That ferrets need to be stimulated and challenged because they’re smart and brave and fearless. That they’re kind and silly and ridiculous and curious. That their hearts are so  so big for such small creatures. ..My husband  Quigley  even Diggle; I wasn’t expecting any of them  but they stole my heart. I’ve missed Quigley every day since he’s been gone. I will never forget a moment of those few years where he was mine. My little love: the very best kind of surprise. . . . #thebookferret #books #bookstagram #bookworm #booknerd #bookpets #bookaddict #bookphotography #bibliophile #instabook s #ferret #instaferret #ferretsofinstagram #petsofinstagram #bookstagramfeature #sockstagram #quigley #missyouquigs #adoptionday #birthday #hewouldhavebeenseven

instagram,Exercise as a celebration of what your body can do  not as a punishment for what you ate. I spent years Suffering from a misdiagnosed disease that stole my ability to move without severe pain... Brushing my hair was so tough i had to sit down in a chair just to finish. I went through boots off temporary paralysis  so working out was out of the question for almost a decade. One of the first things I did when my disease was put into remission was become a personal fitness trainer. Every day I am excited by the abilities and how resiliant the body is and am psyched at the have the ability to exercise.  #chronicdisease #fitmom  #fitmomsofig  #momsofinstagram #momlifeisthebestlife #momlife #fitness #fitnessblog #fitnessblogger #personaltrainer #yogini #momblog #mumblog #blogmom #healthylifestyle #healthymom #fabletics #jogging #Momvibes #HIIT #instamom #fitmommy #firehydrants #myfableticsb #yogaoutside #yogaeverydamnday #celebrateyourbody #motivateme #sundayfunday

instagram,"Motivation is the art of getting people to do what you want them to do because they want to do it. " Dwight D. Eisenhower.  I'm so impressed by all my movement clients  most that I now call friends  that constantly push themselves past what they believe they are capable of. That's what human hero is about... When the human is feeling defeated  it's the job of the hero to reach down and pick them back up.  My goal as a teacher is to shine light on the hero within  so they can lift themselves up  from within. 📸@thegabeayala.

instagram,early mornings with my little bedheaded beauty 🌘✨ #oursweeteverleigh . .  my kids are normalllly really good sleepers (not counting when they’re sick or teething or going through a leap/spurt/regression). Typically  Ro (3) goes to bed at 7:45pm and sleeps until around 7/7:30am. Ev (18 mo) goes down at 6:45pm and is usually up around 6:30/7am. Killian (6 weeks) doesn’t have a set schedule just yet. How old are your littles and what do their sleep schedules typically look like? 😴
instagram,Don't deliver a product- deliver an experience.  Finding the perfect gift to give can be stressful so we tend to think out-of-the box presents like cocktail tours  gelato making workshops  or an exciting sail on a 158ft ship.  The team @xperiencedays makes selecting  a present easier by creating a one stop shop in offering gift giving experiences.  We mentioned them in our Mother's Day gift giving guide #ontheblog  and we can't wait to show you what to give for dad for Father's Day!  #thesocialny #ad ⠀ ⠀

instagram,You know what's weird? For the longest time  I did not know how to be at peace with myself. If I made a mistake. If I was alone. If I was overwhelmed. If I was scared. If I was tired. If I was hurt. If I was hungry 🤪😂... But honestly  it's taken me YEARS to teach myself how to not want to control everything. To instead  just take a deep breath in  hold it for a moment  then LET IT GO. One practice that has helped me is #yoga. This purple mat has been with me since 2015. It's been a place to breath  stretch  relax  get uncomfortably sweaty  cry a little and restart a lot. I'm about to hit another "start button" in life. It's not necessarily going to be easy. But it aligns with my bigger life purpose and dreams. So on this rest day  I did a 30-minute #vinyasa flow sesh. And I'm ready. God has prepared me. And He continues to prepare each of us. For the longest time  it was weird trusting The Universe/God. But so much has changed me within one year that I know that's my core. Make time for things that bring you peace  heart center and positive flow. 💜 . . . . . . . . #heartcenter #mindbodysoul #bliss #relaxation #flexibility #recoverymode #positivity #deepbreaths #healthylifestyle #yogi #bodybuilding #loveyourself #yogastudio
instagram,When I was growing up  gelato was a special treat I used to always get visiting the Jersey shore  so I was pretty ecstatic for the all-you-can-eat @gelato_festival_america this past weekend! I had the honor of judging delicious gelato  and every competitor brought their creativity and A-game: @lolasgelato @theknottedcone @lungelateria @gelatocimmino. I tried everything from the competitive flavors  Razzle Ricotta and Sassy Sea Turtle to just delicious flavors like the Blueberry Mascarpone. The sunny backdrop of 86 degree weather in the middle of October helped  too!  #gelato #dessert #dessertporn #phoenix #phoenixfood #phxeats #phoenixfoodie #azblogger

instagram,“What a waste of a body!” I’ve heard that at least a dozen times in my life. Usually prefaced with “how tall are you?! do you play basketball?!” When I reply with No  that’s the usual response. What a waste. I used to believe it.  As a 6 foot fall teenager who couldn’t make a sports team to save my life (I even heard a swim coach laugh at my attempts) I really didn’t understand WHY I was so big.  Why I took up so much space.  Why I couldn’t get a date because I towered above the opposite sex from 2nd grade on. Fast forward and now I know.  Yes I’m tall and big.  But I am strong.  I am noticeable  which I used to hate but now I see the blessing in being recognized and heard.  I am a large presence in body & mind. I grow babies in a long torso and wrangled in 3 wild little boys at a time and could hold them safe close to me. I can lift furniture with my husband💪🏻 I can see well at all concerts🤘🏻 I can reach all my cabinets👍🏻 Sure I can never be fully submerged in a bubble bath  I can’t lift my hands up in rooms with ceiling fans and I have to do a deep squat in public restrooms to see my face in a mirror BUT I’ve found that taking up space is what I was meant to do. I shared some thoughts on the tall girl’s shopping problems in my stories today that had a huge response of women frustrated with their larger statures so I thought I’d pop in here to tell you you’re just the size you need to be for your purposes in life♡ and I REALLY believe there is beauty in every size. #betterbodylove ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Until however  last night! I was up editing a video until 3am and didn't even feel sleepy one bit. I decided to film a completely raw video last night and started to edit! I love creating visual content with purpose and am super excited for the "new" channel direction (which is mentioned in the actual video- uploading tomorrow!)
