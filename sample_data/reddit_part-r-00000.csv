Reddit,"Are you really implying we return to those times or anywhere near that political environment?  If ""so "" you won't have much luck selling the American people on that governance concept without ushering in American Revolution 2.0."
Reddit,No one has a European accent either  because it doesn't exist. There are accents from Europe but not a European accent.

Reddit,"Nihilum and LG are significantly better off in theory. I can't really think of a replacement for Ptr that would leave CLG in a better place than they were before. Cloud9 should be much ""better "" but you never know."
Reddit,Fuck that what
Reddit,Don't diss the Grim Puncher!
Reddit,"Your 16 bars seems to focus on introducing yourself rather than a life you think is worth living. I understand if you introduced yourself in a few lines that made sense to the theme such as the line “I fear my life remains ""aimless "" I traded paper for a lane switch.” That made sense to the theme because it could be used to tell the audience how you don’t have a life worth living (yet). But lines like “If you fight ""me "" I'ma show hands and throw down on yo ass like the young motherfucking Sylvester Stallone has” has a place for introducing ""yourself "" but not for the theme of a life worth living."

Reddit,It's not your fault don't think that. Hey if this helps it does then if it doesn't well. At least I can talk about it.I shot my dog. I had him for 10 years. I can home from partying and it was New Years so I was going to shoot off my .40 so...Well I was loading it outside and I shot it off accidentally. Right into my dog. Me having about 5-7 tequila shots into me though if I go to sleep I would wake up and he would be okay. Well if I called a vet when I shot him I could have saved him. Or at least from his pain. So I woke up saw a dead dog in my yard… i cried for hours. That old dog still had a few good years in him. That was my fault and you sitting on a little tiny mouse is more understandable than a man discharging a firearm into a shitzu. Don't feel to bad.
Reddit,and what about all of the players who hit vr 14 after 1.6 but before the removal of them?
Reddit,"I would be tempted to excuse myself to the bathroom every time (so you don't piss him ""off "" because he's your ""boss) "" with disgusting details (for negative reinforcement purposes).

Reddit,"I'm just an ordinary collector like everyone else here. ""Frankly "" I think you and everyone else who do giveaways are awesome.
