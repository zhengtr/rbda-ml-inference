StackOverflow,2015,33742590,0,"<p>i can't imagine what <code>getactor1()</code> does. why would you have a fixed number in the function name?</p> <p>the approach i would take is to store it in a set that supports faster lookups. using either a <code>dictionary&lt;&gt;</code> or <code>set&lt;&gt;</code>. i would store the actors there and then the search should be significant faster. it has the added benefit where it can store any number of actors (since you never know how many actors a movie might have).</p> <p>but. again. it's hard to know why you did it this way so i don't know if that meets your requirements.</p> ".

StackOverflow,2015,33741900,1,"<p>i'm going to venture an answer on this. because i am fairly certain i know the source of the problem.</p> <p>the poster indicated that inline sql (parameterized) was being used. this would also be applicable to a stored procedure. the poster also indicated that there is no parameter in his/her sql named 'type.' this indicates that the problem is nested within the sql statement and the error is produced when attempting to call an internal or user-defined sql function. example:</p> <pre><code>update employee set editedon = cast(@somedate as datetime) </code></pre> <p>if @somedate can't be cast as a valid date time. then the cast function itself can error. here are some observations intended to help solve the problem:</p> <ul> <li>use stored procedures if you aren't using some kind of orm. it takes only minimal time to learn how to use one. and that tiny upfront investment is paid back about 1. 000 times because...</li> <li>as you see. inline sql makes things more difficult to debug. the first thing i would recommend when encountering any type of sql error for which the solution isn't readily apparent. is to execute the stored procedure manually through sql management studio. bypassing c#. this will tell you right away whether the problem is your c# code or your t-sql.</li> <li>use the correct data types whenever possible. don't store dates as nvarchar. or accept a sql parameter as an nvarchar when it is supposed to be a datetime. not only does this make code inherently unsafe and prone to bugs. but. as you start working on larger and larger datasets. performing functions against sql data can be the difference between an index seek and a table scan. and thus (in a severe case). a stored procedure that executes in milliseconds instead of hours. if a field is supposed to store a datetime. then make it a datetime. cast and convert should be used very sparingly in databases whose schema you own.</li> <li>finally. you can (and should) use sql profiler to begin a trace against your database. then you can see the exact query that is being executed. you can copy/paste the query directly from profiler into sql server management studio. play with it until you get it to work. and then fix your c# code.</li> </ul> ".
